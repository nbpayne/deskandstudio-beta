Numbers are limited to 5 people at a time to allow for heaps of hands on experience, and one-on-one feedback from the facilitator.

Topics covered will be announced in advance of each workshop, and will includes areas such as: natural lighting, studio lighting, retouching in photoshop, flash photography, etc,. We always want to hear new ideas on topics to cover so please suggest anything that interests you.
